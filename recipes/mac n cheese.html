<h3>my favourite dish </h3>

<P>This is a completely unpretentious, down-home macaroni and cheese recipe just like my grandma and mom always made</P>
<P>A simple white sauce where you add cheese and a few other flavors with macaroni and a potato chip crust</P>

<h3>ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>macaroni</li>
    <br/>
    <li>butter</li>
    <br/>
    <li>flour</li>
    <br/>
    <li>milk</li>
    <br/>
    <li>cheese</li>
</ul>

<h3>steps</h3>
<ol>

    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
    </li>
    <br/>

    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil</li><br/> 
    <li>Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain.
</li><br/>

<li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium-low heat</li><br/>
 <li>Slowly add flour to butter, whisking constantly; cook until brown and the mixture no longer smells of flour, about 5 minutes</li><br/>
 <li> Pour 1 cup milk into the flour mixture, whisking continually until fully incorporated, about 45 seconds; repeat twice</li><br/>
 <li> Add remaining 3 cups milk to the mixture, whisking to incorporate. Stir Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper into the mixture; season with salt and black pepper.
</li><br/>

<li>Reduce heat to low. Cook sauce, whisking frequently, until it begins to thicken, about 10 minutes</li><br/>
<li> Add about half the package of shredded Cheddar cheese; stir continually until the cheese melts completely. Repeat with remaining half package of Cheddar cheese and the American cheese, about 4 ounces at a time</li><br/>
<li> Once cheese is entirely incorporated, remove sauce from heat.</li><br/>

<li>Stir drained macaroni into the cheese sauce to coat. Divide macaroni between two 9x13-inch baking dishes.
</li><br/>

<li>Mix crushed potato chips, 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, and Parmesan cheese in a bowl. Top the macaroni with the potato chip mixture evenly. Spray the potato chip mixture with cooking spray.
</li><br/>

<li>Bake in preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the sauce is bubbling, 35 to 45 minutes.
</li>

</ol>
